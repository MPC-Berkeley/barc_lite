A python package containing vehicle controllers developed by the MPC Lab at UC Berkeley

## FORCES PRO nonlinear MPC solver

In order to use the FORCES PRO nonlinear solver use the following steps to acquire a license and obtain the python client

1. Go to https://my.embotech.com/auth/sign_in and click on **Request License**. Create an account and request an Academic License. This requires that you fill out a license request form and provide a photo of your student ID. Note that license approval may take a couple of days. See [here](https://my.embotech.com/manual/registration?type=academic) for instructions.

2. After obtaining your license, you need to tie the license to your machine. This is done by downloading the fingerprinter for your OS and running it. This will generate a fingerprint specific to your hardware. See [here](https://my.embotech.com/manual/system_information?type=academic) for instructions. Note that you may transfer the license to a different machine. However this can only be done 3 times.

3. After assiging the license, a client will be generated which you can download to your machine. Note that this client is specific to the machine which is tied to your license. If you transfer the license, you need to download the newly generated client. This zip file includes all of the files for using FORCES PRO in MATLAB and Python.

4. After downloading, unzip the file to your home directory.
